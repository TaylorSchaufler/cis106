## Part 1
Watch these videos:
* [What is Open Source?](https://bit.ly/3bQwE3z)
* [Open Source vs. Closed Source Software](https://bit.ly/3irHu1b)
* [Open Source Basics | Intel Software](https://bit.ly/2LBF8RK)

Answer the following question:

1. What are the advantages of open source?
   - *freedom to modify the software as you please*
   - *the software has more eyes on it to catch bugs and security flaws, and patch them accordingly*
   - *less risk of vendor lock-in*
   - *It's usually free*

2. What are the basic freedoms that make a software open source?
    *Mainly, the freedom to view and edit the source code.*
3. Why do you think people should use the free software/open-source alternative instead of the proprietary version?
    *For me personally, it mostly comes down to 2 things:* 
    1. *It's usually free. Why in god's name would I pay microsoft 70 bucks a year for Microsoft Office when libre office gives me the same thing for free?*
    2. *It gives power to the people. As I understand it, the downside corporations see in it is that they don't have as much of an iron grip on the development of the software. People are free to modify and distribute it as they see fit, which makes it harder for them to profit off of directly with anti-consumer practices such as vendor lock-in.*
4. Watch the following video: [Why is free software important? Richard Stallman - in INT's ENLIGHTENMENT MINUTES.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPPikY3uLIQ) Do you agree with Richard Stallman? Do you disagree? Explain your answer. 

I wish I had a disagreement tbh, cause it would make the "explain my answer" part easier. I'm pretty much on board with what he was saying though. Like I said before, power to the people. That freedom is important.

## Part 2

Research online for open-source or free software alternatives for the applications listed in the table below. Follow the example to know what to fill in the "answer here" section. If you have any questions, ask in slack.

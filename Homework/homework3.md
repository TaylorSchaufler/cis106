# Homework 3 Finding a Linux Distributions to Solve Specific Problems.

Given the scenario, use the internet or go straight to Distrowatch to find a Linux distribution that will fit best. You need to explain your answers in at least 1 paragraph. (4 to 8 sentences). For each distribution provide the following information:
* What is it based on? (Debian, Slackware, Redhat, Arch, etc)
* URL to where it can be downloaded from.
* The Supported processor architecture (x86, x86_64, arm, etc)
  
## Scenario 1: Using a Live Linux Installation

John is fixing Mario’s laptop. He needs to prepare a live USB flash drive that he can boot Linux from so that he can access some important information. The problem is that he only has a 4GB flash drive available. Which Linux distribution would you advise John to use to prepare the live USB installation?

Archbang would be John's best bet. It's a linux distro that only takes up 700mb of memory. That should give John plenty of room to breathe. It also only requires 256mb of memory to run, which should help things run smoothly if Mario's laptop is a potato.

## Scenario 2: Using Linux for parental control
Mario is concerned about his children using the house computer. He has an older laptop that he has not used in a while and has hired you to prepare that laptop for his children to use. Mario wants the children to use the computer mostly for educational purposes so he asks you to install educational tools in it. He is also concerned about his children using the internet so asks you if you could somehow install a web browser/search engine that has parental control or at least blocks adult content. Mario has given you $150 dollars for upgrades so that if needed you can proceed without contacting him. Which Linux distribution would install in Mario’s older laptop? 

Ubermix seems like it would fit the bill. It's a distro completely designed for educational use. It even comes with parental controls for overbearing parents like Mario. On top of that, it's lightweight, so it should work perfectly well on his dinosaur laptop.

## Scenario 3: Linux + Gaming
Johanna is a gamer. She loves playing RPGs and Indie games. Johanna makes a living streaming her gaming sessions on Twitch and YouTube. She is angry because, during one of her live streams, windows 10 decided to install an update. All of Johanna’s games are available for Linux and she is good enough with computers to be able to pick up using a new operating system. Which Linux distribution would you recommend Johanna to try?

The specific distro doesn't actually matter that much for this one, cause you can game on most distros. Pop_OS is what I personally use, and I'd probably recommend it for her too. It's basically like ubuntu but with a more polished ui. She can download Steam, OBS, a wide variety of emulators, and any compatibility tools she might need like Lutris pretty quickly off the pop shop (the built-in package manager). I would, however, recommend dual-booting with windows just in case. There's a lot of compatibility tools to make sure that windows games run well like Lutris and Proton, but it's not perfect, and occasionally you'll get games like Persona 5R that won't work at all, or Fallout New Vegas, where there's a lot of graphical glitches. Even if all the games she currently has run well enough, if she's that much of a gamer that she livestreams, she WILL encounter problems at some point.

## Scenario 4: Reviving an old PC
Giorgina has an old computer that came with Windows Vista. She cannot afford to buy a new computer or update her current PC. Her computer is used for online shopping, reading emails, paying her bills, and listening to music. All her music is on an external hard drive and she normally does not keep important information on her computer. Georgina is willing to pay you to make her computer faster. You have concluded that installing Linux is the simplest and most cost-efficient way to help her. However, in such an old PC, Ubuntu 20.04 will be almost as slow as Windows 10 so you need to find another distribution that is much lighter on system resources and has been designed for running on older hardware. Which distribution will you install in Georgina’s ~~dinosaur~~ PC?

Well, if the computer's specs are too low to run ubuntu, why not just run a more lightweight version of ubuntu? That's basically Linux Lite in a nutshell. It's an ubuntu based distribution designed for running on dinosaurs. Considering she doesn't sound like a very advanced user, she shouldn't have too many issues getting used to it either, cause the UI looks a lot like Windows.

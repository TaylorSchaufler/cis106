# Lab 2: Deliverable 2

## Hardware used to complete project:

- Raspberry pi 4, 8gb RAM
A cheap microcomputer popular with hobbiests, typically used with lightweight linux distros. The most expensive part of the project, but not bad for a small spare server
- 128gb microsd with raspbian installed
Came with the raspberry pi and raspbian pre-loaded, so I just went with that. Raspbian is close enough to ubuntu that I didn't have to switch any of my practices up.
- Keyboard and mouse, and a samsung smart tv
Started out using these for input/output and so I could see what I was doing, but then I figured out how to ssh into its terminal, so since then I've stopped relying on it.

## Technologies learned
- html/css (kinda)
Basically just the formatting language to make a website itself. I started out learning html/css to create the site itself through a tutorial I found on skillshare, but I've already forgotten this part honestly. I just took a simple html page I made earlier that said "hello" on it and used that as the base for my project.
- NGINX
Software allows me to host the site itself. I wouldn't say it's intuitive, but not as hard as I expected either. I chose this over apache cause I've heard better things about it. Apparently it's able to handle a higher load of traffic.
 
- SSH
By simply typing "ssh pi@192.168.1.10" and entering its password, I can access my raspberry pi's terminal straight from my regular computer. This saves me from having to constantly switch between 2 keyboards, one of which is awkwardly positioned due to a lack of deskspace. Additionally, TV monitors weren't exactly made to show off desktop icons or terminals and the like, so it saves my eyes some trouble as well.

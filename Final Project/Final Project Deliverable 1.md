##Questions to Answer

1. Which project will I be completing?

I will host a simple website on a raspberry pi

2. Why did I choose this project?

Partially on recommendation by the professor, but I agree with his reasoning. This is an opportunity to get at least a bit of a head start on learning html/css, which is instrumental to my chosen major and field.

3. What are the possible problems, roadblocks, or difficulties I anticipate during the process of completing the assignment?

One is just financial. The raspberry pi I decided to buy was expensive, though I suspect worth it in the long run. Additionally, though maybe I could just have it linked to through an IP address, I suspect I might need a domain name as well. Not as expensive, but money is money, and I'm not fond of recurring fees. Subscriber burn's a menace.

Additionally, I have to try to learn a new formatting language or 2, and use that to create a simple website. "Simple" is rather ill defined, but I'm guessing that just means I'm not expected to create anything too flashy. The goal is technically to be able to host sites. Though it wouldn't hurt to use the site as practice from time to time.

Lastly, I also have to figure out how to host it to begin with, using software I've never used before.

4. How am I planning to overcome these difficulties?

The financial hurdle is simply overcome by throwing money at it. I already bought the raspberry pi, and should I need to, I'll buy myself a domain name.

As far as learning the languages goes, I've started a skillshare account that I'm using to try to teach myself the basics of html and css. Though, this might cut into the financial issue should I wait too long to do it and end my subscription.

Lastly, as far as learning how to use the software goes, I'll just have to look around for tutorials, or trial and error my way through, occasionally turning to google and reddit for help.

5. How do I think completing this project will help me in my career?

Well, it gives me a head start in learning html and css for my classes, but that's only a small part of it. More importantly, it grants me a good tool to host my own web work from without relying on some cynical cloud company. Ideally, I could use it to host personal projects, as well as maybe a site touting my accomplishments and resume for employers, kinda like [this](https://michaelreeves.us/)

Naturally, though I'm oblivious to what they may be at the moment, perhaps I may also gain insights as to how hosting a website works that I hadn't considered before.

#MANAGING DATA

Note: If there are any issues with my note taking, it's probably partially cause I'm using Vim and not entirely used to it yet. And just a bad notetaker in general. Then again, my Vim notes have been pretty helpful so far, even though I missed the directional movement instructions. 


Backup: Copies files and directories to an archive
system backup: Use to restore data in case of a system failure or data loss and corruption
Archive: File containing many other files, each of which is still identified by its filename, owner, permissions, and timestamp
Important directories to include in system backups:
- /etc contains core config files, security files, network config files, user and group info, etc
- /home each user has a /home directory
- /opt software and packages added after the default installation
- /root root user's home directory
- /var system-specific information that changes while the system is running normally


##Archiving utilities
- Tar (tape archive): creates archives by combining files and directories into a single file
- CPIO: Creates an archive, restores files from an archive, or copies a directory hierarchy. The cpio utility has 3 modes of operation:
	1. Create (copy-out) mode places multiple files into a single archive
	2. Extract (copy-in) mode restores files from an archive
	3. Pass-through (copy-pass) mode copies a directory hierarchy

##The tar program:
Usage:
- To create an archive:
	Tar + options + archive name + files to add to archive
- To extract an archive:
	tar + options + file to extract

-c or --create; Creates an archive file
-t or --list; Lists an archive's contents
-x or --extract; Extracts an archive's contents
-f or --file; Specifies the archive file's name and location (ALWAYS REQUIRED)
-v or --verbose; Displays details about copying files to and extracting files from archives
-z or --gzip, --ungzip; Filters an archive through gzip

'tar -cf files.tar file1 file2' - creates an archive called files.tar, and archives file1 and file2 within it.

'tar -cf myfiles.tar ~/Downloads/* ~/Pictures/*' - archives everything in Downloads and everything in Pictures directories. To archive the folders themselves, simply remove the asterisks. To only archive pdf files in that, instead write '~/Downloads/*.pdf'. For multiple specific extensions, '~/Downloads/*.{jpeg, png, gif}' or whatever extensions you're looking for.

A file in an archive is called a 'member'.

Desperately had to take a bathroom break, so hopefully I didn't miss much. Apparently we're talking about curl? Sorry if that's a problem, but I'd rather my room didn't smell like an amazon warehouse.

J option that wasn't mentioned before: decompresses.

-r adds files to an existing archive

##The CPIO program
CPIO requires a list of files to archive. The option to create an archive is -o
- ls | cpio -ov > archive.cpio
To extract an a archive to cpio use the -i option with <
- cpio -iv < archive.cpio
Archive specific files
- find . -iname *.sh | cpio -ov > scriptsArchive.cpio
Create a tar archive with cpio
- cpio -idv -F sample.tar
View the content of *tar Archive File
- cpio -it -F sampl-r adds files to an existing archive

##The CPIO program
CPIO requires a list of files to archive. The option to create an archive is -o
- ls | cpio -ov > archive.cpio
To extract an a archive to cpio use the -i option with <
- cpio -iv < archive.cpio
Archive specific files
- find . -iname *.sh | cpio -ov > scriptsArchive.cpio
	- the . can be ANY PATH (I think, losing track of what's going on cause I'm spending more focus on typing so I have good notes)
Create a tar archive with cpio
- cpio -idv -F sample.tar
View the content of *tar Archive File
- cpio -it -F sample.tar
Extract *.tar Archive File using cpio
- cpio -idv -F sample.tar
View the content of *.tar Archive File
- cpio -it -F sample.tar

##The ar utility
The GNU ar program creates, modifies, and extracts form archives.
It's similar to tar, and I don't think this slide will be up for long.
Yep, it wasn't.

##File compression
VERY important to keep costs down on storage
The first 3 seasons of silicon valley were apparently about it. Might wanna make a point of watching that show when I'm not desperately backed up on work.

Some patent troll copyrighted the word "compress". I really hate copyright law...

- Compress was originally the name of a utility for file compression.
- Gzip (GNU Zip) has better compression ratios than compress does and can uncompress files that were compressed using the compress command FUCK
Slide changed

- Gzip, bzip2, and xz compress files in place meaning the original file is deleted after compression.
= bzip2 offers better compression ratios in compariosn to gzip
- xz produces better compression ratios than both
- 7zip is apparently the best, though xz is similar.

DO NOT confuse gzip with zip. Zip is used to pack and unpack zip archives containing several files compressed into a single file that has been imported from or is being exported to a Windows system.

gunzip == gzip -d
bunzip == bzip2 -d
unxz == xz-d

terminal's blocking the rest, including what that means.

- Zip is an archiving and compression utility. As is 7zip and rar.
- rar is proprietary, so we can't make them in linux. We can extract them though.
- To use zip: zip + archiveName.zip + files to include in archive.
- To use the fucka;lsdfkvj'awle I needed that. I was gonna write down what the 7zip package was on linux so I could install it. Guess I'll have to go to github for that.


File compression 7zip stuff I missed cause of technical difficulties (computer froze not long after I entered the call)

#Linux File Permissions

###File Ownership
- A file can be owned only by one user and one group
- ls -l shows you the file user owner and group owner
- The /etc/passwd file contains a list of all the users in Linux
- The /etc/group file contains a list of all the groups in Linux
- The chown command is used for changing group owner.
Syntax: chown user:group file
Example:
chown john file.txt
chown :marketinGroup file.txt
chown john:marketingroup file.txt

I wish I comprehended what I just typed, but I just mindlessly typed ;-;

###Files vs Directories

R (read) gives permission to open a file
W (write) gives permission to open a file and edit
X (execute) allows user to run the file (as long as it's a program or a script)
It's different with directories, but NO TIME

rw-r--r-- 1 martin users 0 2012-04-11 09:20 file1
The hyphen represents a permission that hasn't been granted
In this example, it means the user doesn't have execute permission
The group category is set to r--, meaning the group only has read permission
Similarly, the other category is set to r--, meaning every user on the system (other than file owner and group) has read permission but not write or execute

###The chmod command

The chmod (change mode) command is used to change permissions on files and directories and has the syntax: chmod permissions file/directory

##Symbolic notation

u (user)
g (group)
o (other)
a (all)

chmod u+x script.sh
chmod o-x script.sh
chmod 


### Example of all of this

zeyo@pop-os:~/Downloads$ touch file1

chmod u=---, g-w, o-r
would leave a freshly made empty file with no user permissions, only write group permissions, and only read other permissions. This is assuming that beforehand, it starts with all 3 having read and write permissions, but not execute.

numeric notation:
0 = ---
1 = --x
This sucks to write them all out, but the syntax would be 'chmod 042 filename'

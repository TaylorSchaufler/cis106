From the console, to commit changes to my repository, I should do the following commands:

git pull
git add .
git commit -m "Task: description of whatever I did here"
git push

I'm not entirely sure what these commands necessarily do individually yet, but they should allow me to update my repository for this class, allowing me to submit my assignments
Writing this here mostly as a reminder, though also for future reference in future projects. I don't remember what to do to link the project properly, but when I do,
I hope I have the insight to update this file to reflect that step.

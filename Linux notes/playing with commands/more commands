the cat command is used to display the content of a file
cat -n lets you number the lines
cat -b numbers lines, without counting lines that are empty other than newlines in that numbering
cat -s suppresses empty lines

tac is the opposite of cat, in that it lists lines in reverse order, from bottom to top instead of top to bottom

more is a pager program. Unlike cat, allows one to move their (in-terminal) cursor up and down. Not an editor, just a viewer. Can navigate using the arrow keys. Using the space bar brings you to the bottom and quits.
more -10 shows them 10 entries at a time
less is another pager program that displays the content of a file one page at a time. It's generally preferable, due to being faster, as more loads all pages at once, taking up more RAM.

The head command displays the top N numbers of lines of a given file. 
example: head -15 todo.md lists the first 15 lines

cut [option] [file] cuts out characterse from a list while displaying I think, had to step out a moment
robertalberto.com/linuxcommands/commands/cut.html is useful for looking up commands

cut -d ':' -f1 /etc/passwd lists all the users on your system
Jesus christ, these are going by fast
cut -d ':' -f1,7 --output-delimiter=' = ' /etc/passwd does something involving a delimeter

The paste command does... a thing, fuck.asdkfljasssssssssscm mn
It basically concatonates 2 files, kinda.
paste -d = ip.txt users.txt
outputted for me in the home directory
192.168.1.100=jdoe
192.168.1.101=mmary
192.168.1.102=katyx
=

sort -o sorteduser users.txt
asdofiklnadeswlnaeswf/;

wc -l /etc/passwd tells you the amount of entries in that file/directory
wc -l /etc/passwd | cut -b 1,2 sends the output of the first wc command to the second cut command, removing the characters "/etc/passwd/" from the output.

If my notes seem sparse, I apologize, but I usually don't take notes for a reason. It's an unnecessary amount of extra stress that I can usually just look up later if I have questions, and it makes it harder for me to focus in class on what they're actually doing.

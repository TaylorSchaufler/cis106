Linux can run multiple processes at the same time, rather than doing instructions 1 by 1

FUCK ADHD, WORK ADDERALL DAMN YOU

Linux uses tree like structure, root being the "source", and everything else being branching paths from there

Root is represented by / I think

pwd displays current directory
cd changes directory 
	to change to a folder in the directory you're in, you can just do "cd foldername".
	to change to a specific folder, you can also just type out the specific directory
	cd ../ lets you go back a directory, cd ../../ lets you move back 2, etc
	clear clears the screen, as a reminder
	using no argument in cd automatically takes you to your home directory (not /home, but /home/username)
	cd ~ also does that, I think?
	cd $HOME also does it
	cd - takes you to your previous working directory
	man ls displays how it works, verious commands I think, etc
	ls -lh shows file sizes in directory

lsls lists the files in the current directory
